                I was born in Memphis, TN in the fall of '89 and raised in the city and the surrounding area. 
                I've been living in the Middle Tennessee area for the majority of my adult life with plans 
                to explore the area a little more before I make a departure.

                My current career path has me lead me to have a littany of different jobs during the last 10 years.
                I went from working in retail, food service, hospitaltity, landscaping and I even spent some time as 
                a postal carrier. While this definitely seems like it's all over the place on paper, these jobs 
                have taught me the importance of developing soft skills, critical thinking in high pressure situations,
                and problem solving. I definitely have no regrets with the path I have taken so far.

                A few of my hobbies are as followed: Dancing (I've taught and performed on and off for 10+ years)
                Hiking, reading, cooking, watching movies, exploring new cities/traveling, playing my bass guitar,
                and going to listen to live music/live shows. I guess you can add coding to that list as well now!

                My favorite sport to watch it a toss up between Football and Basketball but I am generally interested
                in most sport. My favorite teams are the Dallas Cowboys and the San Antonio Spurs. You would think I 
                was a native Texan but that isn't the case. lol. As far as my favorite food goes, could I really consider 
                myself a Memphis Native if I didn't like BBQ?!
