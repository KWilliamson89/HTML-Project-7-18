                <h3>Who I am</h3>
            <p>My journey so far into software has been a very interesting one. It really began back in 2012
            when I witnessed a really good friend teach himself how to code in one summer while I watched in the background
            while playing Halo Reach. I've flirted with the idea on and off for a few years now but never pulled the trigger.
            </p>
           
            <p>
                After 2020 and how much of an effect that had on myself (and the world at large), I decided to 
                take the time to finally learn. No longer could I deny the pull it had on me. Combine that with my 
                voracious appitite to learn, I began to self-teach last year.
            </p>
           
            <p>
                I have dreams of helping the unhoused in my community as well as making sure young aspiring artist
                (The kiddos!) have an outlet to express themselves safely. Learning software devlopement is a vehicle
                that I hope I can use to work towards that aspiration!

            <h3>Skills I hope to learn</h3>
            <dl>
                <dt>Javascript</dt>
                <dd>To be exact, I look forward to having a deeper understanding of this language.
                    Some of the frameworks available make it possbile to learn things outside of front-end
                    developement and that excites me!
                </dd>
                <dt>More intuitive CSS</dt>
                <dd>The things people have created with just pure CSS and how far the push it is just
                    plain awesome to me! I have a little CSS in my toolkit but I would love to push what CSS can do.
                </dd>
                <dt>How to learn other languages more quickly</dt>
                <dd> I have the belief that one we go indepth with Javascript, learning other languages may become 
                    more intuitive moving forward. I for one, am excited to see what that process will entail
                    once we're finished with our time at Pivot!
